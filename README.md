# Poly-1

## Advanced Calculator (Vercel-ready)

This project is a fully client-side advanced calculator with scientific functions, percentage handling,
constants, memory keys, angle toggles (DEG/RAD), history, and keyboard support. It is designed to deploy
directly to Vercel as a static site.

## Local Development

You can open `index.html` directly in the browser, or run a small static server:

```bash
python -m http.server 5173
```

Then open `http://localhost:5173`.

## Deploy to Vercel

1. Push this repository to GitHub.
2. In Vercel, click **Add New Project** and import the repo.
3. Choose **Other** framework preset (static) and keep defaults.
4. Deploy.

No build step is required because the app is pure HTML/CSS/JS.
